Prepare a device.

Small hard drive will do.

Make two partitions, one should be larger than 10 Gbytes and one is larger than 1Gbytes.

e.g. "fdisk /dev/sdg"

"n"
"e"
"l"
"enter"
"+50G"
"..."
"p"
"w"

Do the same thing above to make a second partition.

execute ./AUTOSTART

Note that making and testing GCC or Glibc procedure takes long time.
I incorporated sources into ./sources which you might use them.
Be patient.
Good luck.
